# React Native Login Screen with Atomic Design Pattern

This is a React Native example project that showcases the implementation of a login screen using the Atomic Design Pattern. The project has been created based on the principles outlined in the article [Building a React Native Login Screen with Atomic Design Pattern](https://geniecoder.com/blog/react-native/building-a-react-native-login-screen-with-atomic-design-pattern/) by Genie Coder.

The Atomic Design Pattern is a methodology for creating design systems that breaks down user interfaces into smaller, more manageable components. The pattern provides a structured way of organizing design elements, making it easier to maintain and update large projects.

This example project demonstrates how to create a simple login screen using the Atomic Design Pattern. The project includes various components such as atoms, molecules, and organisms that have been organized based on the Atomic Design principles. It also includes sample data and stylesheets to provide a better understanding of how the components work together.

To learn more about the Atomic Design Pattern and how it can be implemented in React Native, you can refer to the article [Overview of the React Native Atomic Design Pattern](https://geniecoder.com/blog/react-native/overview-of-the-react-native-atomic-design-pattern/) by Genie Coder.
